🌍 SOCIAL IMPACT EVALUATION OF PROJECTS IN CHILE 📊

  📌 Overview: This project aims to evaluate the social impact of various projects in Chile, focusing on three key levels:
  
  📊 Social Baseline: Characteristics of the affected population.
  
  📈 Impact Variables: Direct effects of the projects on communities. 
  
  🛡️ Risk Mitigation Variables: Measures to reduce negative impacts.

The analysis provides insights into how these variables influence the perception and success of the projects, offering valuable information for future initiatives.

🗂️ Project Structure
The project is structured into several sections, each focusing on different aspects of the social impact evaluation:

  📂 Data Loading and Preparation: The project begins by loading and preparing the dataset, which includes information about various projects, their locations, and social indicators.
  
  🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The dataset is explored to understand the distribution of key variables, such as population, unemployment rates, and community organization levels.
  
  📊 Hypothesis Testing: Several hypotheses are tested to understand the relationship between social baseline variables and the perception of the projects.
      
  📉 Impact Analysis: The impact of the projects on social cohesion, employment, and environmental perception is analyzed.
      
  🛠️ Risk Mitigation Analysis: The effectiveness of risk mitigation measures is evaluated, focusing on community satisfaction and compliance with commitments.
      

🔑 Key Findings

  📉 Unemployment and Project Perception: There is a strong correlation between the unemployment rate in a region and the perception of the project. Higher unemployment rates tend to correlate with more positive project perceptions.
  
  🌾 Indigenous Population and Project Perception: The analysis did not find a significant relationship between the indigenous population and project perception.
  
  🤝 Social Cohesion and Conflict: Projects with higher risks of displacement and potential conflicts tend to have more negative perceptions.
  
  🛡️ Risk Mitigation: The satisfaction with risk mitigation measures does not vary significantly across different projects, suggesting that mitigation efforts are perceived similarly across the board.
